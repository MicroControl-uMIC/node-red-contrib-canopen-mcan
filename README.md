> Node-RED Nodes for MicroControl CANopen devices

With these Nodes you can connect [MicroControl CANopen modules](https://www.microcontrol.net/en/products/io-module/box/) to 
[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/). 

## Requirements



## Development

To test the node module locally the `npm install <folder>` command can be used. This allows you to develop the node in a local 
directory and have it linked into a local node-red install during development.

In your node-red user directory, typically `~/.node-red`, run:

```shell
npm install <location of node module>
```
